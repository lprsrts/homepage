When André-Marie Ampère formulated his law for magnetic fields generated by steady currents, he considered only **stationary, time-independent** situations.  
His formulation worked for parallel wires carrying steady currents, but experiments later revealed **inconsistencies** when different integration surfaces are chosen and currents varied with time.

Ampère’s force law for two current elements is given by:

$$
d\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I_1 I_2}{r^2}
\left[ 2 \frac{(\hat{r}\cdot d\mathbf{l}_1)(\hat{r}\cdot d\mathbf{l}_2)}{1}d\mathbf{l}_1\cdot d\mathbf{l}_2 \right]\hat{r}
$$

For two long, parallel wires this reduces to:

$$
\frac{F}{L} = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi d}
$$

Ampère’s original law, written in integral form, is:

$$
\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I
\tag{1}
$$

However, this **fails for a charging capacitor**.  
If one chooses the integration surface that cuts through the wire connecting to the capacitor, a nonzero current \( I \) passes through it, and Eq. (1) holds.  
But if the surface is instead taken **between the capacitor plates**, no conduction current crosses it, so \( I = 0 \).  
This discontinuity violates the **continuity of current** and introduces inconsistency. Additionally, the magnetic field that fills the space must be analytically continuous in the homogeneous medium.

To restore consistency, a new term with the correct physical dimensions is required.  
Using **Stokes’ theorem**, Eq. (1) becomes:

$$
\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} =
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} =
\mu_0 \int_S \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

Thus, for any surface:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}
\tag{2}
$$

If we take the **divergence** of both sides:

$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) = \mu_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}
\tag{3}
$$

The left side is identically zero because the divergence of a curl is identicaly zero:

$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) = 0
$$

Applying a curl operation to vector field loses its radial outwards information. However, for **time-varying currents**:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} \neq 0
\tag{4}
$$

This contradiction can be resolved by considering the **continuity equation**, which expresses charge conservation:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
\tag{5}
$$

From **Gauss’s law** for the electric displacement field:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho
$$

Taking the time derivative gives:

$$
\nabla \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (5) yields:

$$
\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} \right) = 0
$$

This shows that the **total current density**, including the term \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} \), is divergence-free and thus satisfies charge conservation.

Therefore, Ampère’s law is corrected to:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} \right)
\tag{6}
$$

Expressing it in terms of the **magnetic field intensity** in vacuum \( \mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0} \):

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}
\tag{7}
$$

The additional term \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} \) is known as **Maxwell’s displacement current**, which restores current continuity and enables the propagation of **electromagnetic waves** in free space and dielectrics. That is why it is called Ampère-Maxwell Law.
