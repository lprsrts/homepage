Studying for EMW. I worked through the first problem sheet, deriving the wave equation from Maxwell's equations. The math was straightforward, but then a term in the solutions caught my eye: the Helmholtz Equation. It's a version of the wave equation, but time-independent. How can that be? A wave is, by definition, a phenomenon in time and space.

It seems the key is a mathematical tool, the complex phasor. We assume the wave is purely sinusoidal, with a constant frequency $\omega$. So, we write the field as a spatial part, $\underline{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{r})$, multiplied by a time-rotating part, $e^{j\omega t}$. When you substitute this into the full wave equation, the time derivatives $\partial^2/\partial t^2$ magically transform into a simple multiplication by $-\omega^2$. It feels like a trick. My first thought was that we must be losing information by dropping the time dependence from the differential equation.

But the information isn't lost. It's just... encoded. By making the initial assumption that the wave is a pure sinusoid, we've already defined its entire behavior in time. All that's left to know is its structure in space. The time information is now represented algebraically by $\omega$ (or the wavenumber $k$). We've separated the problem. We solve the simpler spatial problem—the Helmholtz equation—to get a "map" of the wave's peak amplitude and phase everywhere in space. Then, at any point on that map, we can bring time back just by multiplying by $e^{j\omega t}$ and looking at the real part. We haven't lost the time, we've just temporarily set it aside to make the spatial problem solvable.

So, what does the solution to this spatial problem look like? For a plane wave, it's something like $\underline{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{-j\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}$. When I combine this with the time part, I get the full expression: $\underline{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{j(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})}$. I can almost see it in my head. There are three distinct parts, three complex rotators.

 * The $\underline{\mathbf{E}}_0$ is the starting point. It's a constant complex vector that sets the wave's maximum strength, its direction of oscillation (polarization), and its phase at the origin at time t=0. It’s the reference for everything.

 * The $e^{j\omega t}$ is the engine. At any single point in space, this term makes the field vector rotate in the complex plane, describing its sinusoidal oscillation over time.

 * The $e^{-j\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}$ is the propagator. This term organizes the oscillations in space. It tells me the relative phase of the oscillation as I move from one point to another.

A point of confusion arose from the lecture slides. The phase was written as $(\omega t - kz)$. My intuition felt that $(kz - \omega t)$ made more sense, with the positive direction z moving forward. But after thinking it through, I see that both forms describe a wave moving in the positive z-direction. The direction is determined by the relative sign between the time and space terms. If they are opposite (like in $ωt - kz$ or $kz - ωt$), the wave moves forward. To make it move backward, the signs have to be the same, like $ωt + kz$. The choice between $ωt - kz$ and $kz - ωt$ is just a convention, tied to whether you define the time-oscillation as $e^{j\omega t}$ or $e^{-j\omega t}$. It’s crucial to be consistent.

Visualizing the spatial part, the phase is controlled by the dot product $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}$. It's largest when the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is parallel to the direction of propagation $\mathbf{k}$. At first, this made me think the wave should fade away as you move further from the origin, because the value gets bigger. But that was a mistake, confusing the phase with the amplitude. The term $e^{-j\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}$ is a pure rotator; its magnitude is always 1. A larger value for $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}$ just means the phase vector has spun around more times. It hasn't shrunk. The amplitude for this ideal plane wave is constant everywhere.

This all connects to a more fundamental idea: the superposition principle, or Huygens' principle. Any wavefront can be thought of as an infinite collection of point sources. I can imagine how an infinite line of point sources, each emitting a spherical wave, would blend together to form a perfect cylindrical wave. And a whole plane of these sources would form a new plane wave. It's beautiful. The math shows how a spherical wave from a very distant star, when viewed over a small area like my eye, has wavefronts that are so slightly curved they are essentially flat. The amplitude is nearly constant over that small area. It becomes a plane wave.

Then I looked at the properties of the medium itself. The lecture notes introduce the "Wellenwiderstand", $Z$, the wave impedance. Why call it impedance? It's a perfect analogy to circuit theory. In circuits, impedance is $Z = V/I$, the ratio of an "effort" (voltage) to a "flow" (current). For an EM wave, the electric field $E$ (in Volts/meter) is the effort, and the magnetic field $H$ (in Amps/meter) is the resulting flow. So, $Z = E/H$. The units are even Ohms. It's a beautiful analogy. The convention is E-over-H because V-over-I was already the standard. The formula $Z = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon}$ also makes perfect intuitive sense—it's the ratio of the medium's reluctance to form magnetic fields $(\mu)$ to its reluctance to form electric fields $(\epsilon)$.

This led to my final big confusion: what happens when a wave hits a conductor? I've always been told that the E-field inside a conductor is zero. So how can a wave propagate through it? The key is that $E=0$ is an electrostatic rule. In that static case, charges have infinite time to rearrange themselves to perfectly cancel the field. But a wave's field is oscillating incredibly fast. The charges try to respond, but they can't form a static equilibrium. Their constant motion is a current, $J$. This is the $J$ in Ampere's law. So $J = σE$. This current term acts as a friction, a damping force in the wave equation. It causes the wave's energy to be converted into heat, and the wave attenuates, dying out within a very short distance (the skin depth).
So the current J causes absorption. But what about the other term in the full wave equation, the one related to charge distribution, $∇(∇·E)$? This term comes from $∇·E = ρ/ε$. So it means that static charges in space must also affect the wave. Do they also absorb it? Not in the same way. This term acts as a source. It couples the wave to the charges. And the result is scattering.
I finally see it now. Scattering isn't the wave "bouncing off" a particle. It's a process of superposition. The incident wave hits the charged particle. The wave's E-field makes the particle oscillate. Because the particle is accelerating, it radiates its own secondary wave. What we observe as "scattering" is the new wave pattern that emerges from the superposition of the original, incident wave and this new, secondary wave from the particle. It just looks like the wave changed direction.
And there must be a delay. The particle has mass, inertia. It's subject to damping forces. It can't respond instantly to the wave's E-field. Its acceleration must lag behind the driving force. This means the secondary wave it emits is also delayed—it's phase-shifted. This phase lag is the root of everything. This slight delay, when superposed with the original wave, is what causes both absorption (when the interference is destructive) and refraction (when the interference just shifts the phase of the total wave, making it seem to travel at a different speed). It all connects back to the simple, classical idea of a delayed response.
